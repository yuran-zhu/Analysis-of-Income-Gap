# Analysis of Income Gap
This is the final project for CMU 94842 - Programming R for Analytics.

The project uses the NLSY79 (National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979 cohort) data set. The NLSY79 data set contains survey responses on thousands of individuals who have been surveyed every one or two years starting in 1979.

The goal is to identify whether there is a significant difference in income between men and women, as well as to investigate other factors that lead to income gap.
